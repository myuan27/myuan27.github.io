I am a Researcher at the Automatic Control research group, [Division of Systems and Control](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/e2/research/systems-and-control/), Department of Electrical Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.

 Previously, I was a Research Fellow at the Rehabilitation Research Institute of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering from University of Melbourne in 2020, advised by Prof [Chris Manzie](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/2763-chris-manzie), Prof [Iman Shames](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/shames-i), Prof [Iven Mareels](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/1614-iven-mareels) (IEEE Fellow, IFAC Fellow) and Prof [Malcolm Good](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/15115-malcolm-good). Before that, I completed my Master's degree in Control Theory and Control Engineering from the [State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries](http://www.sapi.neu.edu.cn/sapienglish/), Northeastern University in 2015, supervised by Prof [Tianyou Chai](https://english.neu.edu.cn/info/1040/2072.htm) (IEEE Life Fellow, IFAC Fellow), Prof [Hong Wang](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/dr-hong-wang) (IEEE Fellow) and Prof Ping Zhou.

I am a recipient of the EU Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action Postdoctoral Fellowship ([MSCA-PF](https://research.chalmers.se/en/project/11168)) in 2023, hosted by A/Prof [Changfu Zou](https://sites.google.com/view/changfu) at Chalmers.
