### PhD Students

* Chi Liu (Main supervisor: Prof Zhezhuang Xu), Fuzhou University, China
  * Project: Load prediction in industrial parks

* Ye Lin (Main supervisor: Prof Zhezhuang Xu), Fuzhou University, China
  * Project: Machine learning techniques for wood Broken Defect Detection

* Jinlong Wang (Main supervisor: Prof Zhezhuang Xu), Fuzhou University, China
  * Project: Optimization of steel plate shuffling and truck loading sequencing

* Yifan Wang (Main supervisor: Prof Wei Tech Ang, co-supervised with Dr Lei Li), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore

  * Project: Graceful following of a mobile balance assistant robotic
    * This project is supported by National Robotics Programme, Singapore. By employing disturbance observer and nonlinear control algorithms, our goal is to enhance the tracking performance of the robot, thereby improving the responsiveness and transparency of the entire system.
