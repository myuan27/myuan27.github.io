### PhD Students

* Chi Liu (Main supervisor: Prof Zhezhuang Xu), Fuzhou University, China
  * Project: Load prediction in industrial parks

* Ye Lin (Main supervisor: Prof Zhezhuang Xu), Fuzhou University, China
  * Project: Machine learning techniques for wood Broken Defect Detection

* Jinlong Wang (Main supervisor: Prof Zhezhuang Xu), Fuzhou University, China
