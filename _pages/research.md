To achieve carbon neutrality and reduce dependence on fossil energy, solar panels, heat pumps and electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming commonplace in European homes. The abundant solar power, geothermal energy, as well as environmentally friendly electric vehicles, reduce the usage of fossil-based energy, while posing challenges to the home energy management system at the same time due to the intermittent feature of renewable energy and potential battery degradation from EVs. This Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship will propose a smart home management system to optimise the entire home energy cost while considering a set of constraints related to battery safety and reliability, driver/household demand, and actuator.
